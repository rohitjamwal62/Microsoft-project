•	Trigger 3: Once the individual's wire transfer has been received (use email confirmation received from Axos Bank in my Outlook 365 account):
o	In MailChimp:
•	Copy the individual from the Prospective Investors audience to the Active audience (unless they're already in the Active audience)
•	Remove the "AEFI Subscribers" tag from their profile in the Prospective Investors audience
•	Add "AEFI Investors" tag to their profile in the Active audience
o	Send the Confirmation of Your Wire Email (see contents at the bottom of this document)
•	Note: since I only have the free version of MailChimp this will need to be done through an Outlook Zap rather than an Automation in Mailchimp
o	Send an email from me to transfer.agency@navconsulting.net with the individual's executed subscription document attached (details at the bottom of this document)
o	Update individual's row on the Equity Sources Google Sheet, specifically populate the field below:
•	Funds Received: today's date
o	Update individual's Lead record in ZohoCRM, fields to update are:
•	Company field to "Investors"
•	Lead Status field to "Pre-Qualified"
